# Generic Website built as a single-page application

## It might not look like much but this is a single-page that makes only one request to the server and loads all of the pages much faster

#### How to run: 
- clone this repository / download it to your computer
- if you don't have http-server installed open the command line
- npm install -- global hhtp-server
- cd into the folder with this project 
- http-server -c-1
- navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
- browse around the website

#### This page was created as a part of the MITxPro Professional Certificate in Coding course with specific instructions on how to build it. 

My contributions were: 
- Moved the SPA navigation to the Nav bar where it belongs
- Removed the disabled button and the search bar from the Nav Bar
- Added pictures and styles for visual appeal
- Added sub-links to the Home page that do not trigger a reload


### Future Improvements
- Add a footer with some navigation too
- Recreate this page with React
